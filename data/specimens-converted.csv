S007,S007_PigEars,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",51.917585,4.481677,2023-04-03,"Placed on the stairs of [Rotterdam's Maritime Museum](https://maritiemmuseum.nl/en), the pig ears (aka skate stoppers), small metallic plates preventing skaters from grinding on the edge of these stairs are a sign of defensive urbanism. Paired with the [mosquito device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mosquito#:~:text=The%20Mosquito%20or%20Mosquito%20alarm,human%20rights%20and%20discrimination%20concerns.) placed above it, they aim to prevent skating, loitering, in a fairly abrasive manner. On the other hand, could it be said these interventions were meant to keep the museum from accelerated deterioration and therefore increase its presentability and hospitality towards visitors (patrons) of the cultural venue?",industrial;rotterdam;skateboarding,models/S007_PigEars.glb,images/S007_PigEars.png
